# NIM
Welcome to NIM. 
NIM is a simple turn based text game developed using Java.
The user is initally asked to declare a number. This is the number that the game revolves around. 
It's now the users' turn. The user then proceeds to select a number (1 or 2). This number is taken out of the initally declared turns.
It's now the computer's turn. The computer selects a number (1 or 2). This number is taken out of the number of turns left.
The last player to choose a number wins.
